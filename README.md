this is my first lab on data structure lecture

In a digital world. A bank must have an application to help the bank's management and database run. 
The importance of database management performance can expedite the work of banks so that they become more effective and exact. 
Therefore we plan to design an application to manage and manage a database of accounts from a bank. We named this bank Bank Wadik.


This bank management application will be shown by the admin and user of Bank Wadik. 
An admin can manage accounts by changing new accounts, editing new accounts and deleting them. 
An Admin can also see the existing account information along with the deposit amount.
Meanwhile a user after logging in can do a number of 3 features. 
Among other things the user can see the user's own information. After that the user can take money. 
This system of taking money from a user after contacting an application will output the code from the system, after which the user will give the code to the clerk to collect money.
The last feature is that a user can transfer another account deposit directly....
